This directory contains the scripts I used to run the Berg and Coop polygenic
adaptation test. The data files are too big to put on GitHub. This mostly
follows the format of example code that Berg (jjberg2) hosts on GitHub. I did,
however, modify the functions script (functions_modified.R) so that covariance
can be computed when there is a small amount of missing data.

GitHub isn't allowing me to sync empty directories, probably because
GitHub and I don't get along. Directories that should house data files
but aren't showing up on github are:
-Trait_Data
-Genome_Data
-Trait_Data100 (not necessary but corresponds with my code to run)

I recommend Berg's example, since he was able to host some useful data
files, but my modification to the functions script could prove useful.

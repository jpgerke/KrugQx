This directory contains the scripts I used to run the Berg and Coop polygenic
adaptation test. The data files are too big to put on GitHub. This mostly
follows the format of example code that Berg (jjberg2) hosts on GitHub. I did,
however, modify the functions script (functions_modified.R) so that covariance
can be computed when there is a small amount of missing data.
